                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</h4>
                <p>Beautiful Store is a social enterprise that helps people with disabilities become independent. Through social enterprises, this is a website that shows disabled people working and earning money like ordinary people and living independently in the world. It is a website that receives donations of unused items or inventory from companies and people, and is a company's return to society activity. This is a store that does.
                    I created a website to promote this company that has a positive impact on society and gives warmth. This company already has a website in Korea. However, I wanted to create a homepage in English, so I borrowed the content from the homepage and used it.</p>

        <!-- Inspiration -->

                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <h4>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h4>
                <p>Inclusion and Empowerment: The Beautiful Shop Foundation's efforts to provide jobs for people with disabilities inspires many. I think this aspect is of great help to society as it can remind us that companies or individuals who feel cold can do things that are difficult to do alone and that they can have a positive impact by actively embracing and supporting marginalized people.<br><br>
                    Continuing movement to save the environment: There is a lot of trash thrown away every year. By emphasizing resource recycling in daily life and creating a culture of sharing, I hope that waste of goods will be stopped, both in our city and globally.<br><br>
                    Social responsibility and community building: If you think deeply about living well, it seems that everyone is focused on making and spending a lot of money. I think it is meaningful because happiness can be filled by seeing others happy.</p><br><br>

                <h4>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h4>
                <p>To make donations easier, I added a donation button to the video. <br><br>
                    A donation button was also added to the header navigation bar, and a navigation bar was also added to the footer.<br><br>
                    For people who don't know how to donate, I added a howto menu and attached a video to make it easier for people to understand.</p><br><br>

                <h4>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site</h4>
                <p>I tried to consistently unify the style.<br><br>
                    I translated the content on the existing website into English and tried to convey the Myeongbo as accurately as possible.<br><br>
                    To make it easier for people to understand, I attached a video so that users can understand what the website is trying to convey.</p><br><br>

                <h4>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site</h4>
                <p>I had a lot of difficulty dealing with CSS and the layout position was quite difficult.<br><br>
                    In order to create a responsive web page, I kept changing various numbers to implement it, but it was difficult because there were many errors. I tried crawling news articles to create a table automatically, but it didn't work as well as I expected, so I changed to entering it manually.<br><br>
                    I wanted to create flashy parts, so I used a lot of JavaScript.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
                <h4>What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful?</h4>
                <p>Although I am still inexperienced, I have become very familiar with using css and html tags, so my work speed has increased significantly. <br><br> I also added a lot of videos and images to make it easier for people to use, and it was nice to see that it was implemented beautifully. I was most proud that the first homepage was completed.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
                <h4>What aspects of your work could be improved?</h4>
                <p>It would be better to open a pop-up so that news articles can be viewed directly on the homepage.
                    I think it would be good to connect the database so that people's inquiries can be accumulated as data.</p>
